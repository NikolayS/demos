Sample notebooks and data organised into datadots. Eventually this should all live in dothub.

In the current example, we use house price data from two estate agents, agent1 and agent2. 
Each of their datasets start in a different datadot and provenance of the data can be traced back to the agent it came from.

TODO:
Add demo of data version control:
* make one agent's houseprice data in $1000s and one in $. Then, in the notebook format all data so houseprices are measured in same units and re-commit the dot.
* add some `NaN` values to some data. Then, in notebook search and remove such malformatted data and re-commit the dot.

Make more sophisticated model using gradient descent to show more realistic parameter settings.
