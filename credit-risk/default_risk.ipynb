    "* bureau: data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau, but one loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.\n",
    "* bureau_balance: monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length. \n",

    "* credit_card_balance: monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.\n",
    "* installments_payment: payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment. \n",

This represents one of the patterns in machine learning: feature engineering has a greater return on investment than model building and hyperparameter tuning. [This is a great article on the subject)](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/secret-to-data-science-success/). As Andrew Ng is fond of saying: \"applied machine learning is basically feature engineering.\" \n",

    "## Polynomial Features\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple feature construction method is called [polynomial features](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html). In this method, we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. For example, we can create variables `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` and `EXT_SOURCE_2^2` and also variables such as `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` x   `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, and so on. These features that are a combination of multiple individual variables are called [interaction terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics) because they  capture the interactions between variables. In other words, while two variables by themselves  may not have a strong influence on the target, combining them together into a single interaction variable might show a relationship with the target. [Interaction terms are commonly used in statistical models](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/interpreting-interactions-in-regression/) to capture the effects of multiple variables, but I do not see them used as often in machine learning. Nonetheless, we can try out a few to see if they might help our model to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jake VanderPlas writes about [polynomial features in his excellent book Python for Data Science](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.04-feature-engineering.html) for those who want more information.\n",

    "In the following code, we create polynomial features using the `EXT_SOURCE` variables and the `DAYS_BIRTH` variable. [Scikit-Learn has a useful class called `PolynomialFeatures`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html) that creates the polynomials and the interaction terms up to a specified degree. We can use a degree of 3 to see the results (when we are creating polynomial features, we want to avoid using too high of a degree, both because the number of features scales exponentially with the degree, and because we can run into [problems with overfitting](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-underfitting-overfitting-py)).
